# Insta-pipe: the bash prototype

Start by running `./viewer.sh`, then open a new terminal
and run `./runner.sh`.

The first 10 lines of output from each command you enter
will show up in the viewer terminal automatically.

The input from previous lines will persist, allowing
you to quickly iterate on complex pipelines.
